name: Publish .NET Tool

# This workflow publishes the .NET tool to NuGet using Trusted Publishing (OIDC).
# 
# Setup required on NuGet.org:
# 1. Navigate to your package page at https://www.nuget.org/packages/Mcpb.Cli/
# 2. Go to "Manage Package" and select "Publishing" or "Trusted publishers"
# 3. Click "Add" to configure a new trusted publisher
# 4. Configure the GitHub Actions OIDC settings:
#    - Subject Repository: asklar/mcpb
#    - Subject Workflow: .github/workflows/publish-dotnet.yml
#    - Subject Environment: nuget (optional but recommended)
# 5. Save the trusted publisher configuration
# 
# Setup required in GitHub:
# 1. Create an environment named "nuget" in repository settings
# 2. Add protection rules if desired (e.g., required reviewers)
# 
# The workflow will run automatically when the version in dotnet/mcpb/mcpb.csproj is changed
# and pushed to the dotnet branch, or it can be triggered manually.
