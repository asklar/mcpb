name: Publish .NET Tool

# This workflow publishes the .NET tool to NuGet using Trusted Publishing (OIDC).
# 
# Setup required on NuGet.org:
# 1. Go to https://www.nuget.org/account/apikeys
# 2. Click "Add" to create a new API key
# 3. Select "Push only new package versions" for the package Mcpb.Cli
# 4. Under "Package owner", select your account
# 5. Under "Packages", select "Mcpb.Cli" (or use glob pattern)
# 6. Under "Source", enable "Trusted Publishing" and configure:
#    - Owner: asklar
#    - Repository: mcpb
#    - Workflow: publish-dotnet.yml
#    - Environment: nuget (optional but recommended)
# 
# Setup required in GitHub:
# 1. Create an environment named "nuget" in repository settings
# 2. Add protection rules if desired (e.g., required reviewers)
# 
# The workflow will run automatically when the version in dotnet/mcpb/mcpb.csproj is changed
# and pushed to the main branch, or it can be triggered manually.
