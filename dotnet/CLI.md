## Commands

### `mcpb init [directory]`

Creates a new MCPB extension manifest interactively.

```bash
# Initialize in current directory
mcpb init

# Initialize in a specific directory
mcpb init my-extension/
```

The command will prompt you for:

- Extension name (defaults from package.json or folder name)
- Author name (defaults from package.json)
- Extension ID (auto-generated from author and extension name)
- Display name
- Version (defaults from package.json or 1.0.0)
- Description
- Author email and URL (optional)
- Server type (Node.js, Python, or Binary)
- Entry point (with sensible defaults per server type)
- Tools configuration
- Keywords, license, and repository information

After creating the manifest, it provides helpful next steps based on your server type.

### `mcpb validate [path]`

Validates a MCPB manifest file against the schema. You can provide either a direct path to a manifest.json file or a directory containing one.

```bash
# Validate specific manifest file
mcpb validate manifest.json

# Validate manifest in directory
mcpb validate ./my-extension
mcpb validate .

# Validate using --dirname without specifying manifest.json explicitly
mcpb validate --dirname ./my-extension
```

#### Additional validation with `--dirname`

Passing `--dirname <directory>` performs deeper checks that require access to the extension's source files:

- Always verifies referenced assets relative to the directory (`icon`, each `screenshots` entry, `server.entry_point`, and path-like `server.mcp_config.command`).
- Add `--discover` (which requires `--dirname`) to launch the server, honor `${__dirname}` tokens, and compare discovered tools/prompts against the manifest without mutating it.
- Add `--update` (also requires `--dirname` and cannot be combined with `--discover`) to rewrite the manifest with freshly discovered tools/prompts and associated metadata.

When `--dirname` is supplied without an explicit manifest argument, the CLI automatically resolves `<directory>/manifest.json`. `--discover` fails the command if capability names differ from the manifest, while `--update` rewrites the manifest in-place (setting `tools_generated` / `prompts_generated` and copying tool descriptions plus prompt metadata returned by the server). Without either flag, `mcpb validate` only performs schema and asset checks.

The discovery step respects the same environment overrides as `mcpb pack`:

- `MCPB_TOOL_DISCOVERY_JSON`
- `MCPB_PROMPT_DISCOVERY_JSON`

These allow deterministic testing without launching the server.

#### Providing `user_config` values during validation

When discovery runs (via `--discover` or `--update`, both of which require `--dirname`), `mcpb validate` enforces required `user_config` entries just like packing. Pass overrides with repeated `--user_config name=value` options. Use the same flag multiple times for a key defined with `"multiple": true` to emit more than one value in order:

```bash
mcpb validate --dirname . \
  --discover \
  --user_config api_key=sk-123 \
  --user_config allowed_directories=/srv/data \
  --user_config allowed_directories=/srv/docs
```

Both spellings `--user_config` and `--user-config` are accepted. If a required entry is missing, the CLI prints the exact flags you still need to supply.

### `mcpb pack <directory> [output]`

Packs a directory into a MCPB extension file.

```bash
# Pack current directory into extension.mcpb
mcpb pack .

# Pack with custom output filename
mcpb pack my-extension/ my-extension-v1.0.mcpb
```

The command automatically:

- Validates the manifest.json
- Excludes common development files (.git, node_modules/.cache, .DS_Store, etc.)
- Creates a compressed .mcpb file (ZIP with maximum compression)

#### Capability Discovery (Tools & Prompts)

During packing—and whenever `mcpb validate` runs discovery via `--discover` or `--update` (both require `--dirname`)—the CLI launches your server (based on `server.mcp_config.command` + `args`) and uses the official C# MCP client to request both tool and prompt listings. It compares the discovered tool names (`tools` array) and prompt names (`prompts` array) with those declared in `manifest.json`.

If they differ:

- Default: packing fails with an error explaining the mismatch.
- `--force`: continue packing despite any mismatch (does not modify the manifest).
- `--update`: overwrite the `tools` and/or `prompts` list in `manifest.json` with the discovered sets (also sets `tools_generated: true` and/or `prompts_generated: true`) and persists the discovered descriptions plus prompt arguments/text when available.
- `--no-discover`: skip dynamic discovery entirely (useful offline or when the server cannot be executed locally).

`mcpb validate` uses the same comparison logic when discovery is enabled. `--discover` requires `--dirname` and fails if discovered capabilities differ, while `--update` (also requiring `--dirname`) rewrites the manifest and cannot be combined with `--discover`.

Environment overrides for tests/CI:

- `MCPB_TOOL_DISCOVERY_JSON` JSON array of tool names.
- `MCPB_PROMPT_DISCOVERY_JSON` JSON array of prompt names.
  If either is set, the server process is not launched for that capability (the overrides also apply to `mcpb validate`).

#### Providing `user_config` values during packing

If your manifest references `${user_config.*}` tokens, discovery requires real values. Supply them with the `--user_config` (or `--user-config`) flag using `name=value` pairs. Repeat the option to set additional keys or to provide multiple values for entries marked with `"multiple": true` in the manifest. Repeated values for the same key are preserved in order and expand exactly like runtime user input.

```bash
mcpb pack . \
  --user_config api_key=sk-123 \
  --user_config allowed_directories=/srv/data \
  --user_config allowed_directories=/srv/docs
```

Quote the entire `name=value` pair if the value contains spaces (for example, `--user_config "root_dir=C:/My Projects"`).

#### Referenced File Validation

Before launching the server or writing the archive, `mcpb pack` now validates that certain files referenced in `manifest.json` actually exist relative to the extension directory:

- `icon` (if specified)
- `server.entry_point`
- Path-like `server.mcp_config.command` values (those containing `/`, `\\`, `${__dirname}`, starting with `./` or `..`, or ending in common script/binary extensions such as `.js`, `.py`, `.exe`)
- Each file in `screenshots` (if specified)

If any of these files are missing, packing fails immediately with an error like `Missing icon file: icon.png`. This happens before dynamic capability discovery so you get fast feedback on manifest inaccuracies.

On Windows, `.exe` entry points or path-like commands can be satisfied by [App Execution Aliases](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/launch-resume/run-desktop-applications-as-uwp-apps). When a referenced `.exe` is not present under your extension directory, the CLI automatically checks `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\WindowsApps` (the folder where aliases surface). To point discovery/validation at custom alias locations—or to simulate aliases in CI—set `MCPB_WINDOWS_APP_ALIAS_DIRS` to a path-separated list of directories.

When discovery launches your server it resolves the executable using the same logic, so an alias that passes validation is the exact binary that will be executed.

Commands (e.g. `node`, `python`) that are not path-like are not validated—they are treated as executables resolved by the environment.

Examples:

```bash
## Fail if mismatch
mcpb pack .

# Force success even if mismatch
mcpb pack . --force

## Update manifest.json to discovered tools/prompts
mcpb pack . --update

# Skip discovery (behaves like legacy pack)
mcpb pack . --no-discover
```

### `mcpb sign <mcpb-file>`

Signs a MCPB extension file with a certificate.

```bash
# Sign with default certificate paths
mcpb sign my-extension.mcpb

# Sign with custom certificate and key
mcpb sign my-extension.mcpb --cert /path/to/cert.pem --key /path/to/key.pem

# Sign with intermediate certificates
mcpb sign my-extension.mcpb --cert cert.pem --key key.pem --intermediate intermediate1.pem intermediate2.pem

# Create and use a self-signed certificate
mcpb sign my-extension.mcpb --self-signed
```

Options:

- `--cert, -c`: Path to certificate file (PEM format, default: cert.pem)
- `--key, -k`: Path to private key file (PEM format, default: key.pem)
- `--intermediate, -i`: Paths to intermediate certificate files
- `--self-signed`: Create a self-signed certificate if none exists

### `mcpb verify <mcpb-file>`

Verifies the signature of a signed MCPB extension file.

```bash
mcpb verify my-extension.mcpb
```

Output includes:

- Signature validity status
- Certificate subject and issuer
- Certificate validity dates
- Certificate fingerprint
- Warning if self-signed

### `mcpb info <mcpb-file>`

Displays information about a MCPB extension file.

```bash
mcpb info my-extension.mcpb
```

Shows:

- File size
- Signature status
- Certificate details (if signed)

### `mcpb unsign <mcpb-file>`

Removes the signature from a MCPB extension file (for development/testing).

```bash
mcpb unsign my-extension.mcpb
```

## Certificate Requirements

For signing extensions, you need:

1. **Certificate**: X.509 certificate in PEM format
   - Should have Code Signing extended key usage
   - Can be self-signed (for development) or CA-issued (for production)

2. **Private Key**: Corresponding private key in PEM format
   - Must match the certificate's public key

3. **Intermediate Certificates** (optional): For CA-issued certificates
   - Required for proper certificate chain validation

## Example Workflows

### Quick Start with Init

```bash
# 1. Create a new extension directory
mkdir my-awesome-extension
cd my-awesome-extension

# 2. Initialize the extension
mcpb init

# 3. Follow the prompts to configure your extension
# The tool will create a manifest.json with all necessary fields

# 4. Create your server implementation based on the entry point you specified

# 5. Pack the extension
mcpb pack .

# 6. (Optional) Sign the extension
mcpb sign my-awesome-extension.mcpb --self-signed
```

### Development Workflow

```bash
# 1. Create your extension
mkdir my-extension
cd my-extension

# 2. Initialize with mcpb init or create manifest.json manually
mcpb init

# 3. Implement your server
# For Node.js: create server/index.js
# For Python: create server/main.py
# For Binary: add your executable

# 4. Validate manifest
mcpb validate manifest.json

# 5. Pack extension
mcpb pack . my-extension.mcpb

# 6. (Optional) Sign for testing
mcpb sign my-extension.mcpb --self-signed

# 7. Verify signature
mcpb verify my-extension.mcpb

# 8. Check extension info
mcpb info my-extension.mcpb
```

### Production Workflow

```bash
# 1. Pack your extension
mcpb pack my-extension/

# 2. Sign with production certificate
mcpb sign my-extension.mcpb \
  --cert production-cert.pem \
  --key production-key.pem \
  --intermediate intermediate-ca.pem root-ca.pem

# 3. Verify before distribution
mcpb verify my-extension.mcpb
```

## Excluded Files

When packing an extension, the following files/patterns are automatically excluded:

- `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`
- `.gitignore`, `.git/`
- `*.log`, `npm-debug.log*`, `yarn-debug.log*`, `yarn-error.log*`
- `.npm/`, `.npmrc`, `.yarnrc`, `.yarn/`, `.pnp.*`
- `node_modules/.cache/`, `node_modules/.bin/`
- `*.map`
- `.env.local`, `.env.*.local`
- `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`

### Custom Exclusions with .mcpbignore

You can create a `.mcpbignore` file in your extension directory to specify additional files and patterns to exclude during packing. This works similar to `.npmignore` or `.gitignore`:

```
# .mcpbignore example
# Comments start with #
*.test.js
src/**/*.test.ts
coverage/
*.log
.env*
temp/
docs/
```

The `.mcpbignore` file supports:

- **Exact matches**: `filename.txt`
- **Simple globs**: `*.log`, `temp/*`
- **Directory paths**: `docs/`, `coverage/`
- **Comments**: Lines starting with `#` are ignored
- **Empty lines**: Blank lines are ignored

When a `.mcpbignore` file is found, the CLI will display the number of additional patterns being applied. These patterns are combined with the default exclusion list.

## Technical Details

### Signature Format

MCPB uses PKCS#7 (Cryptographic Message Syntax) for digital signatures:

- Signatures are stored in DER-encoded PKCS#7 SignedData format
- The signature is appended to the MCPB file with markers (`MCPB_SIG_V1` and `MCPB_SIG_END`)
- The entire MCPB content (excluding the signature block) is signed
- Detached signature format - the original ZIP content remains unmodified

### Signature Structure

```
[Original MCPB ZIP content]
MCPB_SIG_V1
[Base64-encoded PKCS#7 signature]
MCPB_SIG_END
```

This approach allows:

- Backward compatibility (unsigned MCPB files are valid ZIP files)
- Easy signature verification and removal
- Support for certificate chains with intermediate certificates
